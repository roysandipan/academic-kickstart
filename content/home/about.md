# Biography

Sandipan is a Lecturer (US equivalent of Assistant Professor) in Statistics at University of Bath. Sandipanâ€™s core research is at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and optimisation methods. His current research is focussed on modelling data with complex high dimensional network structure and provide methodology for estimating the corresponding structure using tools from nonparametric statistics, graphical models and high dimensional inference. The emphasis is placed on developing new theoretical techniques and
computational tools for network problems and applying the corresponding methodology in many fields, including biomedical and social science research, where network modelling and analysis plays an exceedingly important role.
